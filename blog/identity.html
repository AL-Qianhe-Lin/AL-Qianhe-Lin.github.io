    <h3>Type Four in Brief</h3>
    <p>Fours are self-aware, sensitive, and reserved. They are emotionally honest, 
      creative, and personal, but can also be moody and self-conscious. 
      Withholding themselves from others due to feeling vulnerable and defective, 
      they can also feel disdainful and exempt from ordinary ways of living. 
      They typically have problems with melancholy, self-indulgence, and self-pity. 
      At their Best: inspired and highly creative, they are able to renew themselves and transform their experiences.</p>
      <p><strong>Basic Fear: </strong>That they have no identity or personal significance</p>
      <p><strong>Basic Desire: </strong>To find themselves and their significance (to create an
        identity)</p>
      
      <p><strong>Key Motivations: </strong>Want to express themselves and their individuality, to create and surround themselves with beauty, to maintain certain moods and feelings, to withdraw to protect their self-image, to take care of emotional needs before attending to anything else, to attract a "rescuer."

        The Meaning of the Arrows (in brief)
        When moving in their Direction of Disintegration (stress), aloof Fours suddenly become over-involved and clinging at Two. However, when moving in their Direction of Integration (growth), envious, emotionally turbulent Fours become more objective and principled, like healthy Ones.</p>

      <h3>Mediator(INFP)</h3>
      <p>A <strong>Mediator(INFP) </strong>is someone who possesses the Introverted, Intuitive, Feeling, and Prospecting personality traits. These rare personality types tend to be quiet, open-minded, and imaginative, and they apply a caring and creative approach to everything they do.

        Although they may seem quiet or unassuming, Mediators (INFPs) have vibrant, passionate inner lives. Creative and imaginative, they happily lose themselves in daydreams, inventing all sorts of stories and conversations in their minds. These personalities are known for their sensitivity – Mediators can have profound emotional responses to music, art, nature, and the people around them.
        
        Idealistic and empathetic, Mediators long for deep, soulful relationships, and they feel called to help others. But because this personality type makes up such a small portion of the population, Mediators may sometimes feel lonely or invisible, adrift in a world that doesn’t seem to appreciate the traits that make them unique.</p>
