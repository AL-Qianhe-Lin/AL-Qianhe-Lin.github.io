<h2>Research Neuroplasiticity</h2>
<h3>Discuss how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people. </h3>
<p>It provides a way to look at one’s relationship to learning. That our brains not static, it has the forever potential to absorb and change. </p>

<h3>Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your benefit.</h3>
<p>I guess I’d give myself more empathy and patience, and self-belief. Trying to think times when I am feel frustrated or defeated is not an indication on anything objective or static, allowing these feelings but also remind myself how resilient I can be. 
</p>
    
<h3>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h3>
<p>practice, be present when I learn, engage materials actively. .</p>


<h2>Research Growth Mindset</h2>

<h3>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.</h3>
<p>Growth mindset rejects an ontological state of mindset that is assumed to be fixed and unchangeable. Understanding the growth mindset is relevant as it enables one to embrace failure, as well as ambiguity and uncertainty that might emerge throughout learning, knowing that these feelings don’t define who you are is important. </p>

  <h3>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</h3>
  <p>at first this idea of growth mindset sounds quite cliche and I thought it is obvious, but as I explored it and reflected on it more, it occurs to me that sometimes I am trapped in some sorts of fixed mindset that I don’t realise. </p>

  <h3>How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?</h3>
  <p>I would like to reflect on feelings of defeat, uncertainty and doubt, trying to not think about these feelings as they define me, but rather part of a process. </p>


  <h2>Blend with your learning plan and strategies</h2>
  <h3>Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your learning plan and strategy.
  </h3>
  <p>I want to try to give myself more tolerance and patience. hopefully that would feeds into my drive and confidence.
