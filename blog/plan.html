<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>To be financially stable to sustain my creative practice. </p>

<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
<p>I think I am a fast learner and hard working, but only when there is time pressure. I am not so good at making and following schedules. Sometimes I am easily distracted.</p>
    
<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>Teamwork, discipline, determination.</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>I want try my best to not compare myself with others, to make structure and schedule to manage my scatterness. Also I want to try to be as genuine and kind as I can.
  When things are getting difficult, I wan to try to stay motivated and stick to my schedule, also ask for help.</p>

  <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
  <p>I would try not be shy and ask for help among my peers and facilitators.</p>

  <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
  <p>To make me feel safe to ask for help I guess?</p>

  <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
  <p>I am also working on two other art projects, but they are long term projects. At this stage I want to spend some time on them during foundation, but really focus on Dec when bootcamp starts. </p>
