    <h2>Bootcamp Learning Plan</h2>

    <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
      <p>
      I think a challenge for me will be forming a healthy relationship with pressure. In my past experience
      I found myself thriving and destructing at the same time when I am under pressure. I am also a little anxious
      about the amount of socialising required during bootcamp. I am introverted and can feel quite exhausted. 
      I think my biggest strengths will probably be I will work very hard and try my best to be present for this experience.  
      </p>
    <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
      <p>To perserve my energy. I tend to get tired easily and normally I need 9+ hours of sleep to feel okay lol. I think I
        need to think about a way to sustain myself under the workload. 
      </p>

    <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself whilte at Dev Academy?</h3>
      <p>I want to work on my patience with myself and others. Also just get to know myself more? I feel like I don't really know
        what being an adult looks like or how to function in the real world, I want to reflect on that and use this as an opportunity to
        see how I go. 
      </p>

    <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
      <p>To be sensitive and aware of each students as individuals.</p>

    <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp?</h3>
    <p>I will try to seek help from my peers and facilitators wheN there is need. I will have goals in mind each day and monitor my progress.</p>
  <h2>Foundation Learning Plan</h2>


<h3>What is your long term goal or career pathway?</h3>
<p>To be financially stable to sustain my creative practice. I am also very interested in making games! Been talking to a few people about starting an indie game company haha.</p>

<h3>A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning</h3>
<p>I think I am a fast learner and hard working, but only when there is time pressure. I am not so good at making and following schedules. Sometimes I am easily distracted.</p>
    
<h3>What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</h3>
<p>Teamwork, discipline, determination.</p>

<h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme.</h3>
<p>I want try my best to not compare myself with others, to make structure and schedule to manage my scatterness. Also I want to try to be as genuine and kind as I can.
  When things are getting difficult, I wan to try to stay motivated and stick to my schedule, also ask for help.</p>

  <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</h3>
  <p>I would try not be shy and ask for help among my peers and facilitators.</p>

  <h3>A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team</h3>
  <p>To make me feel safe to ask for help I guess?</p>

  <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things</h3>
  <p>I am also working on two other art projects, but they are long term projects. At this stage I want to spend some time on them during foundation, but really focus on Dec when bootcamp starts.
    I also work one or two shifts at nightime at an art galler, I'm planning to pause that when bootcamp starts. </p>
