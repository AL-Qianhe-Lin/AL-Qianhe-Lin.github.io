<h3>An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.</h3>
<p>If HTML is the skeleton and CSS is the flesh, Javascript can be seen as the brain that tells the body how to interact with itself and others.</p>

<h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life</h3>
<p>Control flow in Javasciprt is how the order that computer runs code, from top to bottom. Loops repeat a series of actions under certain conditions. Take cooking as
  an example: 
  <br>
  <br>
  <span>1. Prepare ingridients</span>
  <br>
  <span>2. Wash and cut ingridients</span>
  <br>
  <span>3. Cook everything</span>
  <br>
  <span>4. Serve!</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  
  The loop can be run everything cooking happens, and conditions can be specified. For example, if soy sauce runs out, that certain action cannot happen,
  there needs to be other events taking place like go buy some or change the recipe.

<h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>

<div class="image">


  <img src="dom.jpeg" alt="dom" style="height:260px;" ></img:>

</div>
<p>The DOM(Document Object Model) is essencially a tree of Objects. DOM 
  enables Javascript the power to make lots of changes such as HTML elements, attributes,
  CSS styles, etc. 
</p>

<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
<p><strong>Objects</strong> represents a 'thing' in a code, which could be anything.
  It can store a set of characteristics called properties, which are made up of a key and a value.
  Properties in objects can be accessed using either dot of bracket.
  <br>
  <br>

  <strong>Arrays</strong> also store a list of items, however, data in arrays are accessed
  by their numerical position in the list, with zero-based indexing, where the first item has
  the position zero, and so on. 
  




</p>

<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.</h3>
<p>A function is a block of code, made to perform a particualr task. A function
  is executed when it is triggered(called). Functions are helpful because codes can then
be reused. Once the code is defined with a function, it can be used many times with different
parameters, thus produce different results. </p>
