<h3>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h3>
<p>In the gradebook Kata challenge, I had some problems with the last stretch exercise. I didn't understand what the test is looking for.
  I first tried googling and just trying something, and reading error messages but still quite confused. I then watched Joseph's video on this 
  exercise but still quite lost. Finally I asked a peer to go through the code with me, I wrote Pseudocode with him along the way and solved the problem. 
  I felt frustrated when I still don't really get it after a lot of attempts. I learnt that being patient is important, also spending time away from it. 
</p>

<h3>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h3>
<p>
  During the FizzBuzz challenge, I used if and else if for multiples of 3, 5, 15. However when the number is
  an multiple of 15, it still returns "Fizz" (for multiples of 3). I looked over the my code over and over again but couldn't figure out why.
  I tried reading error messages and asked my peers for help. At the end someone explained to me the order of code is crucial. 
  Because when a number if a multiple of 15, it has to also be a multiple of 3 and 5, therefore whatever code is the first one it will return that value.
  It makes a lot of sense and unblocks me, by moving lines of code around, it solved th problem. 
</p>
    
<h3>3. Reflect on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h3>


<p>

 
  <span><em>Pseudocode:</em> I haven't got used to the habit of writing Pseudocode, I'm not very patient and sometimes just want to get into writing the code straight away.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Trying something:</em> Somewhat confident, I tend to try a bunch of different things.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Rubber ducky method:</em> haven't tried it yet! But keen to. </span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Reading error messages:</em> it helps me a lot, but sometimes I find the wording a little confusing not generic.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Console.logging:</em> I should get into the habit of doing more...</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Googling:</em> the main source of help for me.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Asking your peers for help:</em> it always end up being very helpful, but sometimes I am hesitant to do so. </span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Asking coaches for help:</em> perhaps I should do it more often..? Still a little bit shy.</span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <span><em>Improving your process with reflection:</em> hmmmmmm </span>
