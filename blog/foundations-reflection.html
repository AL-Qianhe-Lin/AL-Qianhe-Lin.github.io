<h3>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning? </h3>
<p>I learnt that I don’t have to fixate on what I am already, I feel like I am seeing myself with more compassion and open for change and possibilities. I also feel much less competitive comparing to myself in the past, I have been enjoying my own learning and don’t really think about competition anymore later in foundation. </p>

<h3>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
<p>values help forming a sense of who I am and how I choose to see things. Empathy enables me to be patient with myself and others, especially when things get frustrating, which is crucial to move forward. </p>
    
<h3>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
<p>That I don’t have to stay in an obnoxious and cynical mindset, being curious and kind to myself and others is not “uncool”.</p>

<h3>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
<p>I guess the entire process of reflecting on my past understanding of core learning is challenging. I didn’t realise how reluctant I felt at first. .</p>

  <h3>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
  <p>Because anything, no matter how technical oriented, when put into context in the real world, concerns human as human? .</p>

  <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
  <p>To be honest, I have felt that at times. But throughout the process I do see the importance and how core learning benefits me. So I don’t think it’s a waste of time. </p>
